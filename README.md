## 🛠️ Binwalk: Recursive Extraction Risks & Mitigation

### 🚨 Potential Issues When Running `binwalk -eM` on Itself

Running `binwalk` recursively on itself or large binaries (e.g., firmware, packed files) can lead to:

- **Excessive recursion depth**
- **CPU & memory spikes**
- **Disk bloat from endless extracted files**
- **No built-in loop or duplicate content protection**

---

### ⚠️ Recommended Safeguards

```bash
# 🧠 Limit virtual memory to prevent RAM abuse
ulimit -v 500000  

# 💾 Cap max file size (in blocks) to avoid disk explosions
ulimit -f 100000  

# ⏳ Timeout after 60 seconds to stop runaway processes
timeout 60 binwalk -eM binwalk
