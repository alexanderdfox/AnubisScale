# Vulnerability Comparison: `binwalk` vs `AnubisScale` Entropy Scanner

| Aspect                        | `binwalk` (Typical Binary Scanner)                       | `AnubisScale` (Your Entropy Scanner)                       |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Function**           | Extracts and analyzes firmware and binary images, including decompression and filesystem extraction. | Computes entropy-based energy metrics on raw file data for app profiling and anomaly detection. |
| **Code Execution During Scan** | Often calls external decompression tools (`gzip`, `xz`, `unsquashfs`) which run subprocesses and parse compressed data. | Pure Swift code that reads binary data, converts to bits, and performs local mathematical calculations ‚Äî no subprocess or external tool execution. |
| **Attack Surface**             | High ‚Äî relies on multiple external tools and file parsers, some with known vulnerabilities. | Very low ‚Äî no external dependencies or subprocess execution, only file reading and processing in memory. |
| **Vulnerabilities to RCE**    | Possible if maliciously crafted files exploit bugs in decompression utilities or binwalk‚Äôs extraction logic. Known CVEs exist for decompression libs. | Negligible ‚Äî no command execution or unsafe input evaluation. Only reads file bytes and computes entropy. |
| **Sandbox/Escaping Risk**      | High if run with elevated privileges, as external tools may run with user rights and can be exploited to escalate. | Very low as no external processes are spawned and no execution of file content occurs. |
| **File System Risk**           | Potential path traversal during extraction if filenames are unsanitized, leading to overwriting files. | No file extraction or writing except controlled baseline/profile files written explicitly by the program. |
| **Network Exposure**           | Potential if external tools or malware inside firmware initiate callbacks during analysis or if scanner uploads samples to remote services automatically. | None by default ‚Äî only local computation and optionally writes local logs/reports. |
| **Mitigations Required**       | Running in isolated containers/VMs, strict user privileges, validating input archives, up-to-date extraction tools. | Basic file input validation, sandboxing if analyzing untrusted large files, limiting file size read. |
| **Use Cases**                  | Firmware reverse engineering, malware unpacking, deep binary extraction. | App entropy profiling, anomaly detection, tampering detection without unpacking. |
| **Summary**                   | Powerful but potentially risky due to complex extraction pipelines and external tool dependencies, requiring strong security measures. | Lightweight and secure by design, focusing on safe entropy computation without exposing the system to external code execution risks. |

## Recommendations

- Use **binwalk** only within trusted or heavily sandboxed environments.
- Use **AnubisScale** for quick, safe baseline entropy profiling without risk of RCE.
- When extending AnubisScale to unpack archives or analyze internals, incorporate strict sanitization and sandboxing.
- Keep all scanning tools and decompression utilities updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
